# Word-like-editor
I created a simple word like editor using HTML, CSS, JS

It is a simple word processor like MS Word. It consists of different text formatting tools like bold, italic, alignments, changing cases etc. We can add many more ptions to the work. I'm happy to allow you all to make changes to my work and make it a better version.
